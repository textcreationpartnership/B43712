            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N the first day of <hi>March</hi> this present year, 1656. which is called Saint <hi>Davids</hi> day there was one <hi>David Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison</hi> living in the Town of <hi>Meedly</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> a Taylor by trade, who was given very much to mocking, scoffing, and jéering, Swearing, Drunkenness, and the like; It chanced so that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into an Al-house where were som of his acquaintance, he sate down to drink with them, being half drunk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came in; so his Neighbours shewed him civil respect, and bade him sit down: Now mark what after came to pass, this <hi>David Harrison</hi> said, and did swear a most bloody Oath, that he would make all the folks in the house drunk of his own charge, in honour of his name, because it was S. <hi>Davids</hi> day, so calling in for a dozen together, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to drink Healths to one, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, so long, that he had made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so drunk, that he coule hardly go or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:211657:5"/> stand, his Neighbours all perswaded him to forbear swearing and drinking, and ho go home, but the more they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him, the worse he was, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time he drunk he spew'd it up again, and every time he spake he swore a bloody Oath, and at the last he sware God dam him body and soul if he did not drink himself sober again, before he did go out of the house; but in that he was falsly for sworn, for as he put the Flagon pot to his mouth, thinking to have swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed down all the drink, his nose burst out a bleeding, and he fell backwards to tee round like a man distracted of his wits, where he lay cursing and swearing néer upon eight and forty hours, for his bleeding at nose could never be stopt nor stinted, till such time he had bled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to death; and now Ile leave it for all men to judge whether this man had not his death deservedly.</p>
               <p>But surely, though a man will say, that every one shall have that Death which is allotted for them; My opinion is this, if he had served God in a better maner, he might have come to a better end, and that if he had made good use of
<pb facs="tcp:211657:5"/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:211657:6"/>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:211657:6"/> his time, he might have lived many a fair year longer; But to be brief, the matter that is here spoken of was sent up in a Letter from the Masters of the Parish were it was done, and desired to have it put in Print, to the end that all Mockers and Scorners, Swearers, and Pot-companions, both in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and in all other places may take warning hereby, and with speed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their sinfull lives, which GOD grant we may all do.</p>

               <head>Here followeth another strange and tru Relation of the deplorable life and untimely death of <hi>James Parnell,</hi> a Quaker.</head>
               <p>SOme people of <hi>England</hi> are now grown to such a giddy-headed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the like was never known in any Age before, as it ma appear by one <hi>James Parnel</hi> a Quaker, which traveled up and down from place to place prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and teaching false Doctrine, and telling them that all that were not of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:211657:7"/> his Congregation were damned to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; moreover he said, how that the Bible was of none effect, and that <hi>Davids</hi> Psalms were but Ballads: Furthermore he said, that he himself was a Prophet, and that he could do as many Miracles as Christ did do when he was living on the earth, and that he was able to make the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak, the lame to go, the blind to see, and to raise the dead to life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; Now mark what became of him at the last, through his vain-glorious opinion of himself, After he had travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led through many Cities, Towns, and Countries, as <hi>London, Bristol, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester, Exester, Salisbury, Worcester, Hereford, Cicester, Chichester, South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton, the Ile of Wight, Winchester,</hi> and many other places, still teaching the people after his own inventions; He came at last into the County of <hi>Essex,</hi> where he finished up his last dayes, the manner how was thus, he told the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there, that if they would believe in him he would shew them a miracle, and said that as Christ fasted forty dayes and forty nights, so would he undertake
<pb facs="tcp:211657:7"/>

                  <pb facs="tcp:211657:8"/> to do, but for seducing the people, and bringing them to a false belief, and for his Blasphemies, he was apprehended, and sent to <hi>Colchester,</hi> and there kept in prison, where he undertook (as he said he would do) to fast forty days and nights, so because he should have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for his falacy, he was watcht that none should come to give him victuals in private, but if he would eat openly in the sight of the people, he was allowed to have as much victuals as he would desire, to be set before him every day: But to be brief, he still continued in his own wilfull fopperies, and fasted ten days and nights together, and ne er ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted of one bit of bread nor drop of drink, and all this was done because he would have been though to have been a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, but the eleventh day he became to be so hungry, that he had no longer po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to forbear, but call'd for food, and had it brought unto him, but alas it did do him no good, for by reason of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver long fasting, his guts and intrails were clammed up, and clung together, insomuch that the victualls could not have its naturall passage into the parts
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:211657:9"/> of his body which it should have gone into, and so in that miserable taking was starved to death, having plenty of victuals at command, but could not eate.</p>
               <p>And being dead a Iury of men went upon him, whereby to find the true man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the cause of his death, and so at the last they gave up their Verdict to this purpose, that he was guilty of his own death, and that he had done wilfull murder upon himself, in that he restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himself from that bodily sustenance that the Lord in mercy hath ordained for the relief of all mankind: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no one shall have any cause to make any doubt of the truth hereof, it is witnessed by Master <hi>Jude Tayler</hi> the Fore-man of the Inquest, and Master <hi>Joseph Smith,</hi> another of the Inquest, who with the consent of Master Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Gael</hi> of <hi>Colchester,</hi> the Verdict was given in and approved, on <hi>May</hi> the fifth, 1656.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:211657:11"/> Fayre and sold a great many head of Cattle; moreover he said that his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse was in great haste, and that if they <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>UPon the twentieth day of Iuly, this presant year 1656. in the county of <hi>Norfolk</hi> there hapned such a dreadfull tempest of Thunder. Lightning, Hayle Rayne, and Whirle-winds, that the li<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then presently after followed a bright shining Cloud, which the people under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to be a token of Gods mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and so it was indeed, for had the black Clowd continued a longer time there, it is supposed by men of good understanding, that matters had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned worse then they did, and it was too bad as it wwas, for why immedietely there came such a mighty storme of Hayl and Rain that powred down as if Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth would come together, with a strong whirl-wind, that the force thereof beat down many Buildings; and made the Glass windows to flye in pieces, insomuch that five thousand pou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:211657:15"/> Some of the Hail-stones being taken up were found to be as big as Pidgeons Eggs, some as big as Hens Eggs, and some bigger.</p>
               <p>But that's not all, for the Countrey round about felt and suffered greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities; for by the means of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Lightning that fell from the Sky, there were many Ricns of Hay and Corn set on fire, and by the violence of the Thunder, and Whirl-wind, houses were beaten to the ground, and many people lost their lives. A multitude ef Corn was quite destroyed by Lightning and Thunder, and Trées were torn up by the yoots; Birds flying in the ayre were stricken dead, and Herbs and Flowers in fields and Gardens blasted Some grounds that were fruitfull and b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re Corn on Saturday night, was made like Plou'd land before Monday mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: These things (dear Christans) are hard to be believed, but it is known to be too true.</p>
               <p>And now to draw to a conclusion let us consider that this was the handy work of the Almighty God of Heaven and Earth, and that he that did so by them,

               <p>One thing more is to be considered concerning the hayle-stones that fell in the City of <hi>Norwich</hi> how them that were the bigest and greatest of all were of divers severall shapes and fashions, som of them had the likeness of a mans eye to be seen in them, some had the likeness of a mans face; some of them were like Great Buttons which is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion that is now in great request in the City; some of them were like pieces of Ice, and had the likeness of a Lion upon them, and many other strange shapes were then to be seen: These things in the judgment of the world seems to be impossible, but there is nothing impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God; and verile I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that God sent these wonderfull signs and tokens amongst them so sudden and unexpectedly, to put us all in mind of a greater sorrow that will shortly come upon the World, except we speedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and amend our sinful lives.</p>
